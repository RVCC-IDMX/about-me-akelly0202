            <h2>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h2>

            <div>
                <p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young
                    ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt
                    and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia,
                    were particularly frequent in these attentions.</p>

                <p>In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to
                    tell you how ardently I admire and love you. Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She
                    stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the
                    avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed.</p>

                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in
                    want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first
                    entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that
                    he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

                <p>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some
                    perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
                    The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest
                    points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>

                <p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the
                    experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his
                    character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little
                    information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.</p>
